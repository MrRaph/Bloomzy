## Inter-Service Communication

### Authentication Flow
1. Client authenticates with Auth Service
2. Auth Service returns JWT token
3. Client includes token in requests to other services
4. Other services verify token with Auth Service
5. Services process authenticated requests

### Service Discovery
1. Services register with Consul on startup
2. Health checks monitor service availability
3. API Gateway discovers services dynamically
4. Load balancing across healthy instances

### Async Communication
1. Notifications Service uses Celery for async tasks
2. Redis serves as message broker
3. Background tasks for scheduled notifications
4. Inter-service communication via HTTP REST

## Monitoring and Alerting
