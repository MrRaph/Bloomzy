# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Bloomzy is a collaborative platform for intelligent management of indoor plants and gardens, integrating community features, notifications, and AI. The project follows a microservices architecture with Flask backend and Vue.js frontend.

## Development Commands

### Backend (Flask/Python)
```bash
cd backend
make venv          # Create virtual environment and install dependencies
make test          # Run all pytest tests
make clean         # Clean virtual environment and Python cache files
```

### Manual backend setup
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/
```

### Frontend (Vue.js)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Development
make docker-build          # Build Docker images
make docker-run            # Start containers (frontend: localhost:8080, backend: localhost:5080)
make docker-stop           # Stop containers
make docker-logs           # View logs

# Production
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d    # Start production containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down     # Stop production containers

# Manual commands
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d     # Start development containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down      # Stop development containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build     # Build development images
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f   # Follow logs
```

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **Flask Application Factory**: `backend/app/__init__.py` uses `create_app()` pattern
- **SQLAlchemy Models**: Located in `backend/models/` (e.g., `user.py`)
- **Blueprint Routes**: Organized in `backend/routes/` (e.g., `auth.py`)
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented with PyJWT, includes blacklist for logout
- **Database**: Uses SQLite in-memory for development, PostgreSQL planned for production

### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Password hashing using `pbkdf2:sha256` method
- JWT blacklist stored in memory (production should use Redis)
- Protected routes use `@jwt_required` decorator

### API Endpoints
- Authentication routes under `/auth` prefix:
  - `POST /auth/signup` - User registration with email validation
  - `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
  - `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
  - `POST /auth/logout` - Token invalidation
  - `GET /auth/protected` - Protected endpoint example

### Testing
- Uses pytest with fixtures in `backend/tests/conftest.py`
- Test organization by feature: `backend/tests/auth/`
- TDD methodology is mandatory (tests before code)

## Development Guidelines

### Project Methodology
- **TDD Required**: Write tests before implementing features - mandatory for all functionality
- **Git Flow**: Feature branches, PRs, merge to main after validation
- **Documentation**: Keep all docs in `docs/` directory up to date
- **Code Quality**: Factorization and non-repetition - share code and tests whenever possible

### Definition of Done
A feature is considered complete only when:
- It is tested (unit + integration tests)
- It is functional
- It is documented
- It has undergone PR review and validation

### Backend Best Practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration (SECRET_KEY)
- Follow Flask blueprint pattern for route organization
- Implement proper error handling with HTTP status codes
- Use SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Password validation: minimum 8 characters, mixed alphanumeric
- See `docs/backend/best_practices.md` for detailed guidelines

## Key Technologies

### Backend Stack
- Flask 3.0.0 with SQLAlchemy
- JWT authentication (PyJWT 2.8.0)
- Pytest for testing
- Werkzeug for password hashing

### Target Architecture (from PRD)
- Microservices with Docker containerization
- PostgreSQL + Redis for production
- Elasticsearch for search functionality
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

### Docker Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vue.js app built and served via http-server on port 8080 (exposed as 8080)
- **Backend**: Flask app running on port 5000 (exposed as 5080)
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `VITE_API_URL` for frontend API configuration
  - `FLASK_ENV` and `FLASK_DEBUG` for backend environment
- **Network**: Docker network `bloomzy_default` for inter-service communication

## Testing Strategy

Run tests with: `cd backend && make test`

Test files are organized by feature in `backend/tests/`:
- `auth/` - Authentication tests
- `conftest.py` - Shared test fixtures

## Reference Documentation

### PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)
Always consult these before making modifications:
- `docs/prds/bloomzy_prd_general.md` - General specifications
- `docs/prds/bloomzy_prd_architecture.md` - Technical architecture
- `docs/prds/bloomzy_prd_auth.md` - Authentication system

## Important Notes

- **Always start by consulting PRDs and TODO files before any modification**
- Virtual environment must be created in `backend/.venv/`
- Secret keys should never be hardcoded (use environment variables)
- Current JWT blacklist is in-memory; production needs persistent storage
- Database is SQLite in-memory for development
- All API endpoints should return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Email validation uses regex pattern
- reCAPTCHA token validation is implemented for signup

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

### üö® MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS
These rules are **IMPERATIVE** and must be followed at all times:

1. **Backend/Frontend Alignment**: 
   - Backend models and frontend interfaces MUST be perfectly aligned
   - API endpoints MUST match frontend expectations exactly
   - Data structures MUST be consistent between backend and frontend
   - Any change in backend models MUST be reflected in frontend types/interfaces

2. **Docker Container Testing**:
   - ALL development containers MUST be built and tested before any commit
   - ALL production containers MUST be built and tested before any release
   - Docker builds MUST pass without errors or warnings
   - Container functionality MUST be verified after each build

3. **Backend Best Practices**:
   - Follow Flask application factory pattern strictly
   - Use SQLAlchemy ORM for all database operations
   - Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Use JWT authentication with proper token management
   - Environment variables for all sensitive configuration
   - Follow blueprint pattern for route organization

4. **Frontend Best Practices**:
   - Strict separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Use Vue.js composition API and single-file components properly
   - CSS styles MUST be scoped or in separate files
   - JavaScript logic MUST be in separate methods/computed properties
   - No inline styles or scripts in templates
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for API data structures

5. **Code Organization**:
   - HTML template logic MUST be in `<template>` section only
   - CSS styling MUST be in `<style>` section or external files
   - JavaScript logic MUST be in `<script>` section with proper methods
   - No mixing of concerns between HTML/CSS/JS
